rating:3
prep_time:40
instruction:    STEP 1

    Remove the outer leaves from the cauliflower, cut off the stalk and roughly chop, then cut the head into small florets. Toss a quarter of the florets in 1 tbsp oil and 1 tsp of the fennel seeds, season well, then tip into a roasting tin and set aside.
    STEP 2

    Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Heat ½ tbsp oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and add the remaining fennel seeds, toast for 2 mins, then add the lentils and the remaining cauliflower. Stir in the curry paste, then add 1 litre water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 25 mins until the cauliflower is tender and the lentils are cooked through.
    STEP 3

    Meanwhile, put the roasting tin of cauliflower in the oven and cook for 20 mins until crisp and slightly charred. Tip the soup mixture into a food processor and blitz until smooth, tip back into the pan to warm through, adding the lemon juice and a little water if it’s too thick. Tip into bowls and top with the crispy cauliflower and fennel seeds to serve.

name_5:Smoked salmon & spinach gratin
description:Make this easy Swedish-inspired smoked salmon and spinach gratin with just four ingredients. Serve with potatoes and roasted beets – perfect for entertaining
rating:4
prep_time:50 
instruction:     STEP 1

    Put the spinach in a really big saucepan (or two saucepans) and add a few tablespoons of water. Cover, set over a medium heat and cook for about 5-8 mins, turning the spinach over every so often, until wilted. Tip it into a colander to drain and allow it to cool (spread it out on a plate to cool it quicker). Take big handfuls of it in your fists and squeeze out the excess water. It’s really important that you do this, otherwise the water will leach out and make the cream watery and green.
    STEP 2

    Chop the spinach. Melt the butter in a saucepan and gently toss the spinach in it. Season with pepper and a tiny bit of salt (there’s so much salt in the salmon). Heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Lay the spinach in the bottom of a gratin dish (about 30cm x 20cm), then arrange the salmon fillets on top.
    STEP 3

    Heat the double cream in a small pan, then pour it all over the salmon and spinach. Bake for 35 mins, or until the top is golden and the cream is bubbling.

name_6:Sizzled sausage pasta
description:Try this recipe for a dish which is smart enough for adults, but not without kid-appeal. It tastes great cold too, so you can pack any leftovers in your lunchbox
rating:4
prep_time:30
instruction:    STEP 1

    Cook the pasta in boiling salted water according to the packet instructions or until tender.
    STEP 2

    Peel the skins off the sausages and chop the sausage meat into small hazelnut-sized pieces. Chop the sun-dried tomatoes into small chunks. Heat a tablespoon of the sun-dried tomato oil in a large frying pan (big enough to take the pasta later) and sizzle the sausage pieces for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they’re crumbly and golden. Stir in the sun-dried tomato chunks and the remaining oil, and heat everything through.
    STEP 3

    When the pasta is ready, drain it well and toss into the sausage mixture with the parsley. Make sure everything is well mixed and coated with the oil. Season generously with salt and pepper, and serve straight from the pan.
